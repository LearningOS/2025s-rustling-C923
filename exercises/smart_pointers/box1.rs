// box1.rs
//
// At compile time, Rust needs to know how much space a type takes up. This
// becomes problematic for recursive types, where a value can have as part of
// itself another value of the same type. To get around the issue, we can use a
// `Box` - a smart pointer used to store data on the heap, which also allows us
// to wrap a recursive type.
//
// The recursive type we're implementing in this exercise is the `cons list` - a
// data structure frequently found in functional programming languages. Each
// item in a cons list contains two elements: the value of the current item and
// the next item. The last item is a value called `Nil`.
//
// Step 1: use a `Box` in the enum definition to make the code compile
// Step 2: create both empty and non-empty cons lists by replacing `todo!()`
//
// Note: the tests should not be changed
//
// Execute `rustlings hint box1` or use the `hint` watch subcommand for a hint.
